## Animate Core Blocks in Gutenberg Block Editor

Plugin provides an Panel for Gutenberg Inspector which allows you to animate
Core-Blocks. (see screenshots below)

Tested in a WP 6.0
Not sure if this works with all core blocks. But with rather simple ones (like headlines) it should work
no warranty 

It comes with a JS and a CSS File for Frontend.

Animations are only shown in frontend not in the editor.

Ask me if you need the src files
